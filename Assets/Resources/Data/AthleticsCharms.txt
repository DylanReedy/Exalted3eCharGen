In order to survive a very long fall with this Charm, the Solar must use it at least once every three bands. The Exalt can also use this Charm to drift long distances through the air, expending her movement action to float forward a single range band even as she continues to fall. With an adequate amount of thrust, the Exalt can glide across long horizontal distances without falling, equaling her initial movement forward. For example, if she were to leap out over a chasm two range bands across with Monkey Leap Technique, she could then activate Soaring Crane Leap to glide across the second range band on her next turn. Appropriate stunts can increase straight-across movement before the Exalt begins to drop.",

This Charm supplements a non-ranged attack which can be made against aerial targets up to short range, or ground targets at another range band. The Solar leaps at her target, striking with incredible force–damage is doubled after it is rolled. If the Exalt uses this attack to move to another range band, it counts as her moveON TEN OX MEDITATIONFor example, the Solar sees a laden wagon sinking into a sand pit. She has Strength 5, and no time to activate Increasing-Strength Exercise–perhaps someone will die if she does not act instantly. According to the rules on page 229, this feat requires Strength 7, and twelve successes on a (Strength + Athletics) roll. She grabs the hitch, channeling from deep within her reservoirs of might to try to pull it free anyway. The player invokes a full Athletics Excellency, Thunder's Might and Ten Ox Meditation, rolling eighteen successes. The player spends six of these successes to raise the Solar's Strength by two–the minimum needed to accomplish the feat. Because the player still has twelve successes left over, and has raised the Solar's Strength to 7, the Exalt is able to pull the wagon from the sand trap immediately.",

She may dash over unstable surfaces as if they were solid and move over surfaces no thicker than rice paper without breaking through. At full speed, she may also move across lava or other dangerous surfaces without getting hurt. This effect lasts until the Exalt stops dashing. As long as she is moving at a quick pace, she need not pay the activation cost again.At Athletics 5, Essence 2+, the Exalt can pause on unstable surfaces without breaking through, changing the duration of this Charm to “one stunt.” She can walk slowly across the surface of a still pond, pause on the crumbling parapet of a castle to give a speech, and so on. This means if she's using the Charm to dash across the water to reach a boat, then decides to pause on the water's surface to address the captain, she must use the Charm twice. If the Exalt is still standing on an unstable surface and is unwilling or unable to renew Feather Foot Style, she becomes subject to the normal laws of gravity and buoyancy. Also note: while she may safely dash across a caustic or burning surface, standing on top of lava and other dangerous surfaces will cause harm.",

Once she is within combat range of an opponent, attacking is sufficient enough movement to keep her airborne. If she is a ranged fighter, she may also use Unbound Eagle Approach, paying two motes in order to hang in the air, planing along an air current as she takes an aim action. Lastly, the Solar can also channel a burst of speed for two motes, allowing her to rush or disengage from appropriate distances.If she fails to activate the Charm, gets knocked off-course or otherwise begins to fall, Eagle-Wing Style cannot be reactivated until she touches down and is able to leap again.
