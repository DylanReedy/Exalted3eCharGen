   "Description": "With skill and effort, the Exalt guides her arrow to its mark. The Exalt may use this Charm to supplement a withering or decisive attack, reducing the benefits of cover. The defense bonus of heavy and light cover is reduced by one, while characters under no cover suffer a -1 penalty to their normal Defense.In addition, after taking an aim action, the Solar may activate this Charm to strike an opponent in full cover. The Exalt shoots along an arc or angle that perfectly matches her opponent's position. So long as there is some opening where an arrow can get through, Wise Arrow treats a character in full cover as if he merely has +3 Defense.",

   "Description": "The Exalt opens her eyes not to the visual world, butto the world of Essence, sensing her target in that fashion. She may make an Archery attack without penalties for visual conditions. Smoke, fog, and pitch darkness areno longer a problem for her, though other factors such as high winds and cover still apply against the attack. At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can momentarily see through cover, perceiving her targets as silhouettes the colors of bright anima.",

In addition, if the Lawgiver has under seven Initiative, the base damage of this attack gains (Essence) bonus dice.",

   "Description": "The Solar nocks an arrow with purpose, sending a tremulous pulse through her surroundings as she gathers hurricane force into her bowstring. The Solar makes a withering attack from short or close range, and a pulverizing bolt of force surrounds her arrow as it leaps from her bow. If the attack does at least as much damage as her target's Stamina, that Initiative is lost rather than transferred to the Solar, and the target is knocked down and back an entire range band. This force is sufficient to end a rush against any target.",

   "Description": "The Solar strums her bow and fills the air with sharp notes. This Charm allows the Exalt to attack multiple targets, or a single target multiple times, by spreading her total current Initiative between decisive attacks. Each attack must contain at least three Initiative, and extra Initiative must be spread as evenly as possible between shots. For example, an Exalt with 11 Initiative attacking three targets could make two decisive attacks with four raw damage, and a third with only three. In addition, each 10 she rolls on an attack increases the base damage of that attack by one. The Exalt's Initiative does not reset until she has completed every attack, and she may not make more attacks than she has ammunition or Dexterity. This attack can be made without an aim action.",
