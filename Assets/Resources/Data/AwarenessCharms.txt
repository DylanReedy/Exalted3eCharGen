      "Description": "A breath of Essence seals the five senses into a more perfect form. The Solar's senses are heightened and attuned to minute motions and sounds, dim and noisy conditions. She can differentiate between subtle tastes and textures with only the slightest variation. Thus sharpened, it is more difficult for characters to escape her notice, or to deceive her hunting senses. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt's Awareness rolls benefit from double 9s. If the effect of any Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline applies, reroll 6s until they cease to appear. Use of Sensory Acuity Prana comes without the danger of sensory overload; the Charm helps the Solar manage her senses more effectively.",

      "Description": "Upon learning this technique, the Solar's senses guard her from threats she is not consciously aware of. Whenever the Solar is in danger–even if she is not consciously aware of the threat–her relevant senses will home in on the source of danger, enhancing her Awareness to make the threat known to her. Surprise Anticipation Method has two functions. First: for every 9 she rolls on an Awareness check to reveal a hidden enemy, trap, or any source of harm not readily apparent, she gains a single mote of Essence, and for every 10 she gains two. This charge of Essence can only be used to offset the cost of activating Awareness Charms to reveal a threat. Motes returned in this fashion may retroactively lower the cost committed to Awareness Charms of a scene or longer duration, both lowering the committed cost and returning the discounted mote(s) to the Solar's mote pool. Second: her senses function even when she is asleep or Incapacitated, allowing her to use any of her Awareness Charms subconsciously. A threat revealed to the Solar while she is asleep or unconscious automatically revives her, allowing her to defend herself. ON SURPRISE ANTICIPATION METHODThat's not a typo. This is a Reflexive Charm with no cost. Surprise Anticipation Method represents a Solar who has honed her senses to a near psychic degree. They act on her behalf to reveal threats to her. Remember, though, Charms are not actors–it is simply easier to communicate the idea to the player in terms of what a Charm does. In reality, Charms only represent the naturally enhanced proclivities of the character in question, pre-existing, validated by the player's investment of experience points.",

      "Description": "The Solar's visual acuity is heightened to several times that of a normal mortal. This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits: the Solar may perform difficulty 2 or 3 sight-based actions without a roll. She gains an additional two dice to notice hidden persons or devices, to catch sleight of hand and see through disguises. In dim conditions, she sees as well as in broad daylight. Deeper visual hindrances such as dense smoke or fog represent less of a struggle: reduce the difficulty of seeing in such conditions by 1, and remove the -1 penalty to detect hidden threats in such environments. These effects reflect the Exalt's ability to notice and process hundreds of minute details, as well as to focus and manage light sources more effectively. The Solar's visual range is also increased: she can see tiny details at 100 yards, quickly count masses of troops, and notice threats well in advance of her position.Special activation rules: The player may choose to activate Keen Sight Technique by paying six motes, one willpower. Doing so sets the duration of this Charm to Indefinite. Despite being Simple type Charms, each Keen (Sense) Technique can be activated simultaneously by paying the full cost of each. In addition, these Charms are compatible with Sensory Acuity Prana as well as with each other.",

This effect can even contest magic that is considered impossible to notice. The benefit of this Charm only applies to the Solar—it is her eye which is unswerving.

      "Description": "The Exalt's senses of taste and smell are capable of flawless identification of flavors, textures, and scent profiles. This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits, as well as two distinct functions of the senses taste and smell. The Solar can recognize an individual by scent alone, and she can tell older scents from new ones, enabling her to tell how recently an individual was present. Add +2 successes to Survival rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water, using her sense of smell. This Charm automatically extends the range of these actions to (Essence * 200) yards. This Charm also creates a library of scents which your character can reference. Upon learning this Charm, the library is populated with the scents of any Major or Defining Intimacy the character may have, but it can also include scents outside the confines of intimacies if the Storyteller deems them reasonable, including any scent the character has encountered in the last 24 hours, the smell of a favorite food or drink, or scents linked to strong memories such as love or pain. Entries in a Solar's scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree.This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn't populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the charac",

In a bit of overcooked meat, she might sense the cook's turmoil; that his mind is not on his work. In a sip of soup salted with arsenic, she might sense the cool, murderous intent of one who is not her normal chef. This Charm acts as an automatically successful read intentions action to determine the emotional state of the one who prepared a meal or poured a drink.

Before an Awareness roll to detect unseen characters, the Solar's nose automatically counts heads, telling her how many people are in the room, or are within medium range of her. If any scents belong to a person in her scent library, she automatically identifies him. For any unknown, she can further make generally accurate discernments about what kind of being each scent belongs to. Beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits. If a scent is not in her library, she can still form a general idea about the creature it belongs to. At this point, the player can choose to pay two motes to enhance the Lawgiver's sense of smell, aiding her in scenting the direction and distance of each target. This adds one automatic success to an Awareness roll to uncover hidden targets, and to Join Battle if necessary. At Awareness 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can detect dematerialized spirits with this Charm.",

The Exalt may identify fabrics and minerals she knows with a cursory touch, and can hear at frequencies several times lower than a human. She can listen clearly to conversations through thick stone walls, hear creatures burrowing in the ground, ants marching on the branches above her head, and other, similar feats. For many actions that would require success on a roll at difficulty 2, the Solar can succeed without a roll. For more difficult actions, the difficulty is lowered by 1, and the Solar gains one automatic success. If she has a specialty that can be logically applied to the roll, the difficulty drops to 1. For example, a Solar who is unfamiliar with art crime will find it more difficult to identify a faked painting by touch than a Solar with an Investigation specialty in detecting forgeries. These benefits do not apply to detecting opponents in stealth.This Charm follows the special activation rules of Keen Sight Technique (p. 267).",

She can spot a field mouse a mile away, read a letter at a hundred yards, and critique the mating habits of insects. Inzero visibility environments–such as a silt cloud in the belly of a sunken ship–she sees as if she were in a dense fog, using the rules of Keen Sight Technique. She may pick a face out of a crowd with a casual glance, predict a flash flood by counting distant raindrops, and tellif someone is alive by seeing the blood flow throughhis skin. Special activation rules: When Keen Sight Technique is active, any sight-based Awareness Charm is reduced in cost by one mote, to a minimum of one. If the character has learned all three Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline and activates all three Keen (Sense) Techniques, this discount applies to any Awareness Charm.",

The Solar can track her prey's scent with the unerring accuracy of a bloodhound, or find her victim's scent with the methodical sipping of a serpent. The Exalt adds her Perception or a minimum of 2 automatic successes to any Survival-based rolls to track a character or hunt for food or water using her sense of smell, and extends her range for doing so to (half her Essence rounded up) miles. She also gains the ability to scent moods, making an automatically successful scent-based read intentions action to determine a target's disposition.She can add scentless, tasteless subjects to her scent library and taste index. She can also add items to her taste index by merely smelling them, as well as reference those tastes by smell alone. With a harmless drop on her tongue, she can identify a poison she has tasted, and she can detect a tasteless poison by the way it dilutes a drink or acts as an unknown ingredient in a meal whose flavors are well known to her. In addition, bleeding characters (those with a wound penalty of -1 or greater) and characters who are severely injured (-4 wound penalty) are easier to find. Add 1 or 2 dice to an Awareness roll against the target's Stealth.",

The Lawgiver can listen in on a whispered conversation a mile away in still air, or in noisy conditions, such as a raging battlefield, out to long range. She can hear a thunderstorm burgeoning, an army decamping, a tyrant lizard roaring, and other loud noises at (Essence * 5) miles. She can read by passing her fingers over a page and feeling the ink beneath her fingertips. This Charm also confers the following techniques to the Solar:Conjure Image: For one mote, the Exalt can visualize an object she is touching, in sections no larger than a horse's head. She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless cavern. Sense Current: For one mote, the Exalt can feel the lightest motion of air, orienting herself to the exit in even the most lightless of conditions. Read the Web: For five motes committed, the Exalt can listen in on a conversation behind a thick door, just by touching a connecting wall or surface. She feels the vibrations in her fingertips, and her senses translate them to words she can hear. This is a scene length effect, and its range can be extended up to (Essence x100) yards by running a wire from the Exalt's fingertips into a chamber where her targets are speaking. Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one Willpower, the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings–",

So long as she's on the same plane of existence as they are, the Solar can hear the words of her favored people clearly, as if they were in the same room, so long as they are addressing their speech to her. This Charm's duration is Indefinite: each time a character addresses the Solar, she has an instant in which she feels a tingle in the base of her skull, telling her to tune her hearing and listen. Upon activating the Charm, she can hear everything her compatriot wishes to say to her, until the character has been silent for ten seconds or longer.

Eyes blazing white, Caste Mark burning, her gaze shines a wide beam of light across everything she searches, twin lamps moving over the terrain out to long range. Everything caught in her stare is subject to the following effects: All magical and mundane Stealth effects are cancelled. Solid walls and other opaque objects grow transparent as the Lawgiver's gaze passes over them, rendering all forms of Stealth automatically unsuccessful. Fog lifts, smoke parts, and clouds dissolve under the Solar's intense focus. Dematerialized spirits are forced to materialize, at full cost of the Materialize Charm, or as much of the cost as they can pay.",
