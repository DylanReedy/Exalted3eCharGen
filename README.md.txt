# Exalted 3rd Edition Character Builder
A program to help create Exalted (3e) characters, built with Unity.

## About the Project
Exalted is, by far, my favorite RPG setting.  Until 3rd edition, however, it really wasn't my favorite to *play*. Now that the game is so much better to play (in my opinion), I thought
it would be fun to make a character generator for the game. I'm aware of the Anathema and Anathema Reincarnated projects.  This project is in no way meant to undermine or impede other efforts
to make an Exalted 3e Character Generator.

### Primary Needs
I am not an artist or a designer.  I'm a physicist that likes coding. Consequently, this project needs the following more than anything else:
- Art Assets
- UX/UI Input

That said, more people coding always helps! If you see a better way to code something that's already implemented, or feel like there's a feature missing, please feel free to contribute your ideas
and/or work!
