# Exalted 3rd Edition Character Builder
A program to help create Exalted (3e) characters, built with Unity.

## How to Use the Character Builder
I've included an executable version of the Character Builder for testing. If you're a non-GitHub user, here's what you do:
* Find the "Clone or download" button on the right. 
* Download the .zip of the project.
* Unzip the download.
* Find CharacterBuilder.exe inside
* Profit

## About the Project
Exalted is, by far, my favorite RPG setting.  Until 3rd edition, however, it really wasn't my favorite to *play*. Now that the game is so much better to play (in my opinion), I thought
it would be fun to make a character generator for the game. I'm aware of the Anathema and Anathema Reincarnated projects.  This project is in no way meant to undermine or impede other efforts
to make an Exalted 3e Character Generator.

### Contributors
If you'd like to contribute but don't use Unity, I'd be glad to hear verbal (text?) feedback. If you do use Unity, by all means contribute!
